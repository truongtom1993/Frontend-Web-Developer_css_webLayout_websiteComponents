# Landing Page Project

## Instructions

1. The project is publicly available at [Github Page](https://truongtom1993.github.io/Frontend-Web-Developer_css_webLayout_websiteComponents/)

2. This project of mine will describe how Javascript affects a web page

3. In this landing page, there are many sections that when you scroll the page, the sections in the viewport will be appended with the class 'active', with css effects

4. For each section added to the html file, a corresponding button will be added to the navigation bar, when clicking on this button, the web page will automatically scroll down to the section corresponding to that button.

5. When you stop scrolling for 1 second, the navigation bar will be automatically hidden, and when you continue to scroll, the navigation bar will reappear.

6. My javascript code is written in app.js file for your reference.

Thank you.
